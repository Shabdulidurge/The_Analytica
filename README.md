LMN Smart City – Live Command & Control Simulator is an interactive Streamlit-based simulation that models real-time urban operations across multiple city zones. It tracks  traffic congestion  and  citizen complaints , computes a dynamic  risk score , and visualizes zone health in a live dashboard.
Users can explore  what-if scenarios  through three modes: *Live Control* (manual intervention), *Do Nothing*, and *AI Auto-Control*, where a simple AI logic automatically activates smart signals in high-risk zones. The simulator updates city conditions in time steps, highlights high-risk areas, and provides  AI-driven recommendations  to support decision-making in smart city command centers.
